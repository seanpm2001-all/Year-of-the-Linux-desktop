# Year of the Linux desktop

![](/Images/Mascots/Tux/Tux_Enhanced.svg)

Linux is steadily growing in marketshare, and the Linux community awaits the year of the Linux desktop. With growing discontent towards Windows 10, and a rise in Linux marketshare, will this year be the year of the Linux desktop?

Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of February 5th 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Degoogle-your-life/issues/) make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't my GitHub profile page. You will be redirected to the [seanpm2001/seanpm2001 repository](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001), where the README is hosted.

Translations are done with Google Translate due to limited or no support for the languages I need in other translation services like DeepL and Bing Translate. I am working on finding an alternative. For some reason, the formatting (links, dividers, bolding, italics, etc.) is messed up in various translations. It is tedious to fix, and I do not know how to fix these issues in languages with non-latin characters, and right to left languages (like Arabic) extra help is needed in fixing these issues

Due to maintenance issues, many translations are out of date and are using an outdated version of this `README` article file. A translator is needed. Also, as of April 13th 2021, it is going to take me a while to get all the new links working.

## Actual marketshare

Due to Linux not phoning home after installation to increase the number of Linux users (except for Debian/Ubuntu and Google devices, such as Android and ChromeOS) there are only rough estimates of how many devices run Linux, as most often, a computer may come pre-installed with Windows, then have Windows deleted and Linux installed after 1 hour to 15 years (because Linux can bring new life to an old computer, and a lot of people have their final straw with Windows (at least 10000 people switch to Linux every day after frustration with Windows) and install Linux)

## Marketshare by operating system

Here are some lists of Linux marketshare by the operating system category.

### Desktop

Here are the most common Desktop Linux operating system variants

POSITION 	2020 	2019

1 	MX Linux 	MX Linux

2 	Manjaro 	Manjaro

3 	Linux Mint 	Linux Mint

4 	Ubuntu 	Debian

5 	Debian 	Ubuntu

6 	Elementary OS 	Elementary OS

7 	Solus 	Solus

8 	Zorin OS 	Fedora

9 	Fedora 	Zorin OS

### Mobile

Here are the most common Mobile Linux operating system variants

2021

1. Android (~70-85%)

2. Ubuntu Touch (~0.2-1.4%)

3. No data available for 3rd entry

Source: [1. Android (en.wikipedia.org)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) [2. Ubuntu Touch (ubuntu-touch.io)](https://ubuntu-touch.io/)

## Embedded

Embedded Linux variants are not often named, and data cannot be found for this section. A list of device types will be listed instead.

* 3D printer

* 2D printer (just a normal printer)

* Gas powered truck

* Electric powered truck

* Calculators

* Airplane control panels

* Nuclear powerplant control panels

* Voting machines

* Gas powered cars

* Electric powered cars

* Cruise ships

* Scanner radios

* Security camera systems

* DVRs (such as TiVo and Roku)

* Refridgerators

* Cleaning robots

* ATM machines

* Dishwashers

* Washing machines & drying machines

* And much more.

## Servers

Linux is used on the majority of computer servers. Even Microsoft uses Linux over Windows on their servers.

All 500 of the worlds top supercomputers run Linux.

## Rovers

Linux is the main operating system on NASAs rovers.

## Overall Linux usage in the Milky Way Galaxy

Overview: Linux was created on earth in 1991, but has spread to other planets (confirmed usage on Mars, as of 2021)

### Earth

![](/Images/Galaxies/MilkyWay/Earth/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg)

**Desktop marketshare:** `~4.65-20%` including 500/500 of the top 500 supercomputers, most common systems being Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) Fedora Linux, Arch Linux, and ChromeOS.

**Mobile marketshare:** `~75%-85%` mostly consisting of Android devices. iOS is not included, as it is based on Darwin (BSD)

Embedded marketshare (cars, trucks, planes, boats, etc.) `~95-98%` - If your vehicle or other machine (such as a printer/3D printer) has a computer in it, it most likely runs Linux due to Linux being so lightweight. Linux is so lightweight, people have managed to mod mechanical 1930s typewriters to run it.

**Server marketshare:** `~96-99%`

Note: due to Linux not phoning home after installation to increase the number of Linux users (except for Debian/Ubuntu and Google devices, such as Android and ChromeOS) these are rough estimates of how many devices run Linux, as most often, a computer may come pre-installed with Windows, then have Windows deleted and Linux installed after 1 hour to 15 years (because Linux can bring new life to an old computer, and a lot of people have their final straw with Windows (at least 10000 people switch to Linux every day after frustration with Windows) and install Linux)

### Mars

![](/Images/Galaxies/MilkyWay/Mars/OSIRIS_Mars_true_color.jpg)

**Rover marketshare:** `100%`

Note: On February 18th 2021, the Perseverance Rover (made by NASA) successfully touched down on Mars. It runs Linux, and is now the only Linux device on Mars, and the only computer still running on Mars.

## Other

Some other info about Linux.

### Development

Linux development is open source and done by contributors all around the world. The value of volunteer work done to Linux is over $5billion (as of 2019)

On GitHub, the [Linux Kernel repository mirror](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) is very close to 1 million commits (as of April 13th 2021 at 3:36:34 pm, it is currently at 998,143 commits)

### Stability

Linux has become much more stable over the years, and the majority of computers can handle it with relatively few driver issues (unless you have an NVidia based GPU) 

In the late 90s and early 2000s, Linux had issues with audio devices. These issues have mostly been resolved, but some still remain.

### Security

Due to Linux being based on the UNIX philosophy (with its more secure UNIX roots) and Linux being open source, Linux is far more secure and contains far fewer bugs per 300 lines of code compared to Windows (1:10)

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am ussing the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
